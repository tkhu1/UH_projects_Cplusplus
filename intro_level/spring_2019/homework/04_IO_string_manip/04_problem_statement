Homework 4 Instructions

In this homework, you will be tasked with creating functions to manipulate strings that come from files and then outputting the strings to 
another file. All of these functions are housed together in a menu. The user will be asked to input a file name and then their menu 
selection.

The menu is this:

Get rid of white space
Print amount of characters in the file
Print amount of words in the file
Replace all vowels with 3's
Print the file lines in reverse order

Input will look like this: "input1.txt 2". You can assume there will be no numbers in the input files. Make sure that you have variables 
to store both the input file name and the integer selection.

Menu Items Explained

Delete all spaces between words and print that to the new file, line-by-line
Count the number of characters in the whole file, not including spaces, and print that to the new file
Count the number of words in the whole file and print that to the new file
Replace all vowels with 3's and print that to the new file, line-by-line
Given the order of the file lines (Ex: 1 2 3), print to the new file the reverse (Ex: 3 2 1)
Each operation must be performed by a separate function.

There should be nothing printed to the console, all input is taken from one file and outputted to another file! The output file should 
be named output.txt!
