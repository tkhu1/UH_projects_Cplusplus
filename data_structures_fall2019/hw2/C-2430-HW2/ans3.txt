There are places I'll remember All
All my life, though some have changed some
Some forever, not for better
Better some have gone, and some remain
Remain all these places had their moments with
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Recall some are dead, and some are living
Living in my life, I've loved them all my
My life, though some have changed
