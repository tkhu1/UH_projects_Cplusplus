Recall some are dead, and some are living
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Living in my life, I've loved them all my
There are places I'll remember All
Remain all these places had their moments with
My life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Better some have gone, and some remain
All my life, though some have changed some
