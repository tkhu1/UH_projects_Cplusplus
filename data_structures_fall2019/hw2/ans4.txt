Colors weave into a spire of flame
Flame distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Unnamed bear this torch against the cold of the night
Night search your soul and reawaken the undying light!
Light! on that day when the sky fell away
Away our world came to an end
End in our eyes, did a fading sun rise
Rise in the dark glimmering shadows
Shadows silence grows in the spaces between
Between stretching out beyond time
Time rising up as a chorus of souls
Souls find a voice
Voice flickering through the void
Void these little sparks cling on to life
Life everyone caught in the struggle
Struggle and then the storms of change
Change they fan the flames
Flames scattering ashes to the wind!
